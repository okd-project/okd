          Before reporting an issue, check our backlog of
          [open issues](https://github.com/okd-project/okd/issues)
          to see if someone else has already reported it. If so, feel free to add
          your scenario, or additional information, to the discussion. Or simply
          "subscribe" to it to be notified when it is updated.

          information within 14 days, we cannot debug your issue and will close it. We
          will, however, reopen it if you later provide the information.
