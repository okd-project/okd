# Install OKD 4 on top of an UPI libvirt+kvm configuration

This guide explains how to configure libvirt+KVM to provision Fedora CoreOS and install OKD on top of it.

## Assumptions
- The host OS is CentOS 9;
- This guide will not configure the load balancer or the DNS server. Check for [LB_HAProxy.md](../vSphere_govc/Requirements/LB_HAProxy.md) and [DNS_Bind.md](../vSphere_govc/Requirements/DNS_Bind.md) if you want to configure them;
- Fedora CoreOS will still use DHCP for obtaining the IP, but with a MAC address-based reservation into the libvirt network configuration, and therefore there is no need for a standalone DHCP server;
- You already downloaded the OKD installer and command line tools from the Release section of this repository, and installed them into a path added to the `PATH` environment variable.


## Pre-tasks
1. Download from [Fedora CoreOS](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos/download) website:
    - Installer ISO
    - Kernel
    - Initramfs
    - Raw image

We're not installing Fedora CoreOS from PXE, we still need to download the kernel and the initramfs, as we're going to use the Direct Kernel Boot feature of libvirt to inject kernel boot parameters.

2. Configure a webserver
Configure a simple webserver to host the ignition configs and the raw image. These files will be downloaded by the CoreOS installer and deployed to the VMs.


## Walkthrough

### Configure libvirt network
Create a simple NAT network. Even the "default" network created by libvirt is fine.

There's no need to specify the IP reservation at this point, since the VMs don't exist yet. You can add the records in the dhcp block later.
```
<network connections='3'>
  <name>openshift</name>
  <forward mode='nat'>
    <nat>
      <port start='1024' end='65535'/>
    </nat>
  </forward>
  <bridge name='virbr0' stp='on' delay='0'/>
  <ip address='GATEWAY' netmask='NETMASK'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='DHCP START IP RANGE' end='DHCP END IP RANGE'/>
      <!-- Add the following lines after you'll get the MAC address of your VMs
      <host mac='BOOTSTRAP MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4bs' ip='BOOTSTRAP IP'/>
      <host mac='MASTER 0 MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4m0' ip='MASTER 0 IP'/>
      <host mac='MASTER 1 MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4m1' ip='MASTER 1 IP'/>
      <host mac='MASTER 2 MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4m2' ip='MASTER 2 IP'/>
      <host mac='WORKER 0 MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4w0' ip='WORKER 1 IP'/>
      <host mac='WORKER 1 MAC ADDRESS' name='okd4w1' ip='WORKER 2 IP'/>
      -->
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
```

### Create the install-config.yaml
Login to [Red Hat Cluster Manager](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) portal and obtain a pull secret. I chose Bare Metal as UPI provider.

Create a SSH key pair for SSH login to the cluster VMs, and then create your install-config.yaml, like the following example:
```
---
apiVersion: v1
baseDomain: YOUR_DOMAIN
compute:
- hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: worker
  replicas: 0
controlPlane:
  hyperthreading: Enabled
  name: master
  replicas: 3
metadata:
  name: CLUSTER_NAME
networking:
  clusterNetwork:
  - cidr: 10.100.0.0/14
    hostPrefix: 23
  networkType: OpenShiftSDN
  serviceNetwork:
  - 172.30.0.0/16
platform:
  none: {}
pullSecret: 'SECRET FROM RED HAT CLUSTER MANAGER'
sshKey: 'YOUR SSH PUBLIC KEY'
```

Modify it accordingly to the size and the configuration of your cluster and then remember to backup it, because the OpenShift Installer will remove it after generating the Ignition configuration files.


### Generate the Ignition configuration files
```
$ openshift-install create ignition-configs
```

### Provision the VMs
A simple high-available OKD cluster would include 3 control planes and 2 workers. So for such configuration you need for 5 VMs + 1 for boostrapping.
Configure the VM for booting them with the kernel and initramfs you previously downloaded, with the following parameters:
- KERNEL: `/path/of/fedora-coreos-40.20240616.3.0-live-kernel-x86_64`;
- INITRAMFS: `/path/of/fedora-coreos-40.20240616.3.0-live-initramfs.x86_64.img`;
- BOOT ARGS: `ip=dhcp rd.neednet=1 coreos.inst=yes coreos.inst.install_dev=vda coreos.inst.image_url=http://WEB_SERVER_IP:PORT/fedora-coreos-40.20240616.3.0-metal.x86_64.raw.xz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://WEB_SERVER_IP:PORT/SERVER_ROLE.ign coreos.live.rootfs_url=http://WEB_SERVER_IP:PORT/fedora-coreos-40.20240616.3.0-live-rootfs.x86_64.img coreos.inst.insecure`.
Replace `SERVER_ROLE` with `bootstrap` for the bootstrap server, with `master` for control plane servers, and with `worker` for worker servers.
Replace `WEB_SERVER_IP:PORT` with the endpoint of the webserver you previously configured.

Here how you can configure Direct Kernel Boot in `virt-manager`:
![Direct kernel boot](Images/direct_kernel_boot.png)

**NOTE:** CoreOS installer automatically reboot the server after installation, so when the installation of Fedora CoreOS is finished shut down the VMs, otherwise the installer will keep installing the OS.

After the installation disable the Direct Kernel Boot option, as we don't need it anymore.

At this point you can add the VMs MAC address to the network configuration in libvirt, just like the example [above](#configure-libvirt-network). Stop and start the network after that:
```
virsh# net-destroy openshift
virsh# net-start openshift
```

### Start the bootstrap server
After every server in your cluster was provisioned, start the bootstrap server.
By default, Fedora CoreOS will install the OS from the official OSTree image, so we have to wait a few minutes for the machine-config-daemon to pull and install the pivot image from quay.io. This image is necessary for the kubelet service, as the official Fedora CoreOS image does not include hyperkube.
After the image was pulled and installed, the server will be rebooted by itself.
When the server is up again wait for the API service and the MachineConfig service to be spawned (check for the ports 6443 and 22623). Check also for the status of the `bootkube.service`.

### Start the other servers
**NOTE:** You can start every server in the cluster in the same time of the bootstrap server, as they will still waiting for the latter to expose the Kubernetes and MachineConfig API ports. These steps were separated just for convenience.

Now that the bootstrap server is ready, you can start every server of your cluster.
Just like the bootstrap server, the control planes and the workers will boot with the official Fedora CoreOS image, that does not contains hyperkube. Since hyperkube is missing the kubelet service will not start and so the cluster bootstrapping.
Wait for the machine-config-daemon to pull the same image as the bootstrap server.
The servers will reboot themselves and after that they will try to join the cluster, starting the bootstrapping process.
After reboot `rpm-ostree status` should show something like:
```
[core@okd4m0 ~]$ rpm-ostree status
State: idle
AutomaticUpdates: disabled
Deployments:

### Install OKD cluster
#### Bootstrap stage
Now that every servers is up and running, they are ready to form the cluster.
Bootstrap will start as soon as OKD will register the master nodes.

Meanwhile on the bastion host just run the OpenShift Installer in order to check the status of the installation:

`$ openshift-installer wait-for bootstrap-complete --log-level debug`

The installer will now check for the availability of the Kubernetes API and then for the `bootstrap-complete` event that will be spawned after the cluster has almost finished to install every cluster operator.
OpenShift installer will wait for 30 minutes. It should be enough to complete the bootstrap process.

#### Intermediate stage
When the bootstrap is finished you have to approve the nodes CSR, configure the storage backend for the `image-registry` cluster operator, and shutting down the bootstrap node.

Shut down the bootstrap vm and then remove it from the pools of the load balancer. If you followed the [LB_HAProxy.md](../vSphere_govc/Requirements/LB_HAProxy.md) guide to configure HAProxy as you load balancer, just comment the two `bootstrap` records in the configuration file, and then restart its service.

After the bootstrap vm is offline, authenticate as `system:admin` in OKD, by using the `kubeconfig` file, which was created when Ingnition configs were [generated](#generate-the-ignition-configuration-files).

Export the `KUBECONFIG` variable like the following example:

`$ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/auth/kubeconfig`

You should now bo able to interact with the OKD cluster by using the `oc` utility.

For the certificate requests, you can approve them with:

`$ oc get csr -ojson | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status == {} ) | .metadata.name' | xargs --no-run-if-empty oc adm certificate approve`.

For the `image-registry` cluster operator things are getting a bit more tricky.

By default registry would expect a storage provider to provide an RWX volume, or to be configured to be ephemeral.

If you want the registry to store your container images, follow the [official OKD 4 documentation](https://docs.okd.io/latest/registry/configuring_registry_storage/configuring-registry-storage-baremetal.html) to configure a persistent storage backend. There are many backend you can use, so just choose the more appropriate for your infrastructure.

If you want instead to use an ephemeral registry, just run the following command to use `emptyDir`:
`$ oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io cluster --type merge --patch '{"spec":{"managementState":"Managed","storage":{"emptyDir":{}}}}'`

**NOTE:** While `emptyDir` is suitable for non-production or temporary cluster, it is not recommended for production environments.

#### Final stage
Now that everything is configured run the OpenShift installer again to wait for the `install-complete` event.

`$ openshift-install wait-for install-complete --log-level debug`

After the installation is complete you can login into your cluster via WebUI using `kubeadmin` as login. Password for this account is auto-generated and stored in `auth/kubeadmin-password` file. If you want to use the `oc` utility, you can still use the `kubeconfig` file you used [before](#intermediate-stage).

**NOTE:** `kubeadmin` is a temporary user and should not be left enabled after the cluster is up and running.
Follow the [official OKD 4 documentation](https://docs.okd.io/latest/authentication/understanding-authentication.html) to configure an alternative Identity Provider and to remove `kubeadmin`.
